2014-03-13 Germline and Somatic mutation detection method without detailed mutation subtype classification 
==============================

Purpose
------------
Corrected Germline and Somatic mutation detection method echos to the result section in the paper. The posterior distribution is used in germline and somatic test. Considering there is no clear  existing terminology for difference types of mutation RVD2 called, we simply classify them as germline and somatic mutation. 

Conclusions
-----------------
This method detects eight germline mutations and eight somatic mutations.
Background
----------------
Please refer to the manuscript pushed on Mar27, 2014 for detailed method.


Materials and Equipment
------------------------------


Experimental Protocol
---------------------------
RUn `MuBarPlot.py` to generate tables with correct setting in source code `rvd27.py`.

Results
-----------

**Figure 1 The bar plot for mu in positions called by new somatic test and Germline test. Positions with star (\*) were called by Somatic test, where case mu and control mu are significantly different from each other.  Positions with diamond were called by Germline test, where control mu is significantly different from the reference.**
