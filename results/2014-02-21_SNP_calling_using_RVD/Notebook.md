2014-02-24 SNP calling using RVD in clinical data HCC1187 PAXIP1 gene
==============================

Purpose
------------
Compare variant calling performance of RVD and RVD2 in clinical data HCC1187 PAXIP1 gene.

Conclusions
-----------------
RVD is able to call variants with no lower than 0.1 downsampling rate. 

Background
----------------

Materials and Equipment
------------------------------
The RVD program was downloaded from [RVD program files](http://hamachi.stanford.edu/publication-material/rvd/matlab/Program_Files.zip "RVD").

Clinical bam files are available in 
`/flahertylab/freeze/HCC1187`; reference fasta file is in `/flahertylab/freeze/hg19/Homo_sapiens/UCSC/hg19/Sequence/WholeGenomeFasta/genome.fa`

More information regarding RVD can be found in [Algorithm User Guide for RVD](http://www.webcitation.org/query.php?url=http://dna-discovery.stanford.edu/software/rvd/&refdoi=10.1186/1756-0500-6-206)

Experimental Protocol
---------------------------
Please run matlab script RVD.m for the overall process.
