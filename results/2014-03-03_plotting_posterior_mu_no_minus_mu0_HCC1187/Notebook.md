2014-03-03 Histogram of empirical mu of positions called by MuTect in HCC1187 data
==============================

Purpose
------------
Plot the histogram of of empirical mu of positions called by RVD2 in HCC1187 data without subtracting mu0

Conclusions
-----------------
Because there are 44k positions and mu0 is very small comparing to muj, the influence of subtracting mu0 is very negligible.  

Background
----------------


Materials and Equipment
------------------------------
Compare the histograms in this experiment to the histograms generated in experiment `2014-03-03_plotting_posterior_mu`, where mu0 was subtracted.


Experimental Protocol
---------------------------


Results
-----------

![]('position154749704.png')
![]('position154766700.png')
![]('position154766732.png')
![]('position154777014.png')
![]('position154777118.png')

Positions that are called by both:

![]('position154753635.png')
![]('position154754371.png')
![]('position154758813.png')
![]('position154760439.png')
![]('position154780960.png')

By comparing the histograms to that from experiment `2014-03-03_plotting_posterior_mu`, it can be seen that the influence of subtracting mu0 is negligible.
