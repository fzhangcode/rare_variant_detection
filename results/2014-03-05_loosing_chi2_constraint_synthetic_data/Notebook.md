2014-03-04 loosing chi2 p-value constraint on synthetic data
==============================

Purpose
------------
As the chi2 test (with Bonferroni correction) is too strict for HCC1187 test, this experiment aims at testing how loosing chi2 p-value constraint will effect ss/fdr in synthetic dataset.

Conclusions
-----------------
Combing the Sensitivity and Specificity table and False Discovery table, the "chi2, mu0=1" option, which means  chi2 p-value is 0.05 without Bonferroni correction and subtracting mu0 in the bayesian hypothesis test achieve the most preferable result.
