2013-07-18 Test on Gibbs sampling steps with Synthetic DNA
==============================

Purpose
------------
To test the effect of Gibbs sampling size on mutation detection accuracy

Conclusions
-----------------
Gibbs sampling size 400 is enough to build the empirical posterior distribution of mu_s. There was insignificant improvement with sampling size at 4000 over 400.
