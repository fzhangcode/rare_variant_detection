2013-08-13 Read depth and precision parameter M evaluation across position
==============================

Purpose
------------
Evaluate the  of properties of precision parameter M across positions.

Conclusions
-----------------
The precision parameter is low in the two ends of positions, while is fairly high in the middle positions. The M varies across positions, but are generally in between 10^4 and 10^5 for most positions.

Background

Figure 1. Precision parameter Mj across positions. The y axis in left panels are in linear scale, while the y axis in the right panels are in log scale.

From the figure it can been seen that the precision parameter is low in the two ends of positions, while is fairly high in the middle positions. The M varies across positions, but are generally in between 10^4 and 10^5 for most positions.
