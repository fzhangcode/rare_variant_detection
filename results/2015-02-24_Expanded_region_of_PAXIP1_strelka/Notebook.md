==============================

Purpose
------------


Conclusions
-----------------
The somatic SNV report 'HCC1187C_HCC1187BL.somaticSNVs.vcf' on HCC1187 downloaded from the same website we downloaded HCC1187 dataset. We can find all the SNVs called by Strelka within the expanded coordinates

Background
----------------
I found the HCC1187 dataset has been deleted from the freezer. However, I do remember I downloaded the dataset from 'https://basespace.illumina.com/datacentral', where free registration is required for data download. The SNV report can be found in the website as well.
