2014-06-18 Apply RVD27 to Elisa's Variomics data
==============================

Purpose
------------
To plot the MAF level of every position in DFR1 gene in Elisa's variomics data. (Yeast DFR1 gene chrXV:780,906-781,541, length 636). 

Results
-----------

**Figure1** The MAF level at each position of generation T0 diploid sample. The y axis is the MAF level presented in basis points (actual MAF *10000), and the x axis represents the positions idex. The actual locations of the 10 positions with highest MAF are annotated in the figure.

**Figure1** The MAF level at each position of generation T0 haploid sample. The y axis is the MAF level presented in basis points (actual MAF *10000), and the x axis represents the positions idex. The actual locations of the 10 positions with highest MAF are annotated in the figure.
