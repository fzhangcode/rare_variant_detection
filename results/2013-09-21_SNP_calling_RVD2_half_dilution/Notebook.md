2013-09-21 SNP calling using RVD2 with threshold set at half dilution
==============================

Purpose
------------
To evaluate the variant detection power of RVD2 with threshold set at half dilution.

Conclusions
-----------------
RVD2 with threshold set at half dilution is not able to detect any variants across all dilution rates and all read depth.

Background
----------------

Materials and Equipment
------------------------------
halfdilution.py


Experimental Protocol
---------------------------

Results
-----------

The program generates vcf files which saves variant calling results. They are available in the same directory.

Using the characer.py in `../2013-09-19_operating_characteristics` it is possible to generate a summarizing table showing the sensitivity/specificity for variant calling using RVD2 with threshold set at half dilution. A screenshot is shown as follows:

It can be seen that RVD2 with threshold set at half dilution is not able to detect any variants across all dilution rates and all read depth.
