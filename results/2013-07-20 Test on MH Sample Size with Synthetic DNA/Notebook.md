2013-07-20 Test on Metropolis Hasting sampling size with Synthetic DNA
==============================

Purpose
------------
To test the effect of Metropolis Hasting sampling sampling size on mutation detection

Conclusions
-----------------
The Metropolis Hasting sampling sampling size has noticeable effect on t value. The optimal value is not yet found since the program is till running.  

Background
-----------------
Given that Gibbs sampling size 400 is enough to build the empirical posterior distribution of mu_s, Metropolis Hasting sampling size of 1,10,50,100 were tried to test the effect of Metropolis Hasting sampling size on mutation detection.
