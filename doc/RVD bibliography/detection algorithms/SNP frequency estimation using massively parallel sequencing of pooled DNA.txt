Abstract: Resequencing of genomic regions that have been implicated by linkage and/or association studies to harbor genetic susceptibility loci represents a necessary step to identify causal variants. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) offers the possibility of SNP discovery and frequency determination among pooled DNA samples. The strategies of pooling DNA samples and pooling PCR amplicons generated from individual DNA samples were evaluated, and both were found to return accurate estimates of SNP frequencies across varying levels of sequence coverage.

Comments:This paper provided the approach of SNP discovery by taking advantage of very high coverage possible with Massively parallel sequencing (MPS). No graphical model was built. The method found 16 SNPs of MAF ranging from 3.7% to 40%. This method also found several new SNPs not present in dbSNP, all but three of which were below 1% frequency.
